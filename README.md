This is a helper to download Youtube videos as Mp3s for offline music access. These shouldn't be used for commercial purposes and users of this script are responsible for all the legal issues around this.

## HowTo:

1. Install [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#readme)
   `pip install youtube-dl`
2. Run `python ytmp3downloader.py`
3. Enter the playlist/video url when prompted

The download speeds are quite low, maybe run it overnight for bulk downloads
